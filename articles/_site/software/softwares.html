<h3 id="catt--an-infinity-categorical-coherence-typechecker">CaTT- An infinity categorical coherence typechecker</h3>
<p>CaTT is a type theory whose models are weak omega-categories, I have implemented
it in OCaml. The development page for the project is available on
<a href="https://github.com/ThiBen/catt">GitHub</a> and there is an <a href="https://thiben.github.io/catt/">online
version</a> available for quick tests</p>

<p>During a research internship under the supervision of <a href="https://www.lri.fr/~hivert/">Florent
Hivert</a>, I have formalized the computation of the
representations of the symmetric groups and their characters using Young
tableaux, in Coq with ssreflect (now mathcomp). The project is available on
<a href="https://github.com/ThiBen/ReprSymGroup">GitHub</a>, note however that it is not
maintained anymore and is outdated, it has been intergrated to
<a href="https://github.com/hivert/Coq-Combi">Florent’s development</a> of algebraic combinatorics.</p>
