###  PhD candidate at UNICOG, Neurospin (CEA/INSERM)

## Research

<div style="text-align: justify"> I am PhD candidate under the supervision of **Ghislaine Dehaene-Lambertz** at Neurospin. I am interested on how the human brain compresses and represents the information in sound sequences with a focus on the amazing capacities of babies to learn their mother tongue.
To explore these questions, I rely on : </div>
- **experimental psychology** : behavioral measures of our cognitive capacities ;
- **neuroimaging** tools such as neonatal EEG or MEG to measure the brain activity during cognitive tasks ;
- **modelling** : use of mathematical and deep-learning models to represent and understand human's ability.


## Background
#### Education
After studying mathematics, physics and computer science in prep school, I joined **CentraleSupelec** where I completed an engineering degree with emphasis on **signal processing and bio-engineering**. In parallel to my last engineering year, I completed a Master degree in **computational biology** at Universit√© Paris-Saclay. 
#### Previous research experiences
During those studies I had the opportunity to take a gap year and work as a research intern : 
- At **University College London** with *Maria Chait* on sound salience its relation with pupil dynamics ;
- At the **McGill Montreal Neurological Institute** with *Robert Zatorre, Philippe Albouy and Benjamin Morillon* on speech and music processing with fMRI data.
