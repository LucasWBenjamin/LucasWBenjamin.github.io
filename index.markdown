###  PhD candidate at UNICOG, Neurospin (CEA/INSERM)

## Research
I am PhD candidate under the supervision of **Ghislaine Dehaene-Lambertz** at Neurospin. I am interested on how the human brain compresses and represents the information in sound sequences with a focus on the amazing capacities of babies to learn their mother tongue.
To explore these questions, I rely on
- **experimental psychology** (behavioral measures of our cognitive capacities)</li>
- **neuroimaging** tools such as EEG (measure of the brain activity during cognitive tasks)</li>
- **modelling** (use of mathematical of deep-learning models to represent and understand human's ability)</li>


## Background
#### Education
After studying mathematics, physics and computer science in prep school, I joined **CentraleSupelec** where I completed an engineering degree with enphasis on **signal processing and bio-engineering**. In parallel to my last engineering year, I completed a Master degree in **computational biology** at Universit√© Paris-Saclay. 
#### Previous research experiences
During those studies I had the oppotunity to take a gap year and work as a research intern at **University College London** working with *Maria Chait* during 6 months. I then moved to Montreal as a reasearch intern at **McGill Montreal Neurological Institute** where I collaborated with *Robert Zatorre, Philippe Albouy and Benjamin Morillon*.
