Welcome to my scientific blog. I have been meaning to create this for quite a while now, in the hope of sharing some of the cool ideas that I encounter in science, and that I don’t see discussed 
As of now, I haven’t decided yet what the entire content will be, but very probably most of it will be related to category theory, with a pinch of computer sciency stuff on top of it. I don’t know either how much vulgarized I want it to be, and I guess it will change from one article to another. But I have a specific first topic that I wish to write about, and which might end up pretty technical.
